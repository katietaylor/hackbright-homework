Hello,

We've been writing a new application for managing customers
and running a weekly raffle of a free melon.

I'm not sure what an &quot;virtual environment&quot; is (sounds like
one of those things lefty nonprofits worry about), but,
according to CTO Today! Magazine, we need to make sure that
developers are setting up their environment correctly
to manage libraries and split up files as needed.

Get up to speed on implementing &quot;virtual environments&quot;
on this project so we don't have any conflicts or missing
requirements. Make sure that you have a .gitignore so your
environment doesn't end up on Github.

We just poached Squysh's 16-year-old wonderkid engineering
manager, Janet, to optimize our process. She says everyone
should install &quot;IPython&quot; as well. You won't need it now,
but try it so you know how to later. Apparently, you'll use
something called &quot;pip&quot;, inside of your &quot;virtual environment&quot;.
Oh, and my golf buddy says you should &quot;freeze&quot; this, so others
can get the same setup. <em>Pip</em>? <em>Freeze</em>? <em>Virtual environment</em>?
This is starting to sound like a science fiction musical, if
you ask me! But we're paying a lot for this advice so make
it happen.

Mel

P.S. I'm not clear what this &quot;virtual environment&quot; is, but
     don't think we're going to buy you any of those fancy
     goggles. All of our discretionary income has gone into
     my new shiny titanium golf clubs.

Oh and make sure you take a look at our app's code.
There is a bug keeping things from working just right.

It's all in this file, &quot;raffle.py&quot;. To use it, you need
to go into Python and &quot;import&quot; it, like so:

    $ python
    &gt;&gt;&gt; import raffle
    &gt;&gt;&gt; raffle.run_raffle()

That causes a problem, though --- some sort of
&quot;import error&quot;, whatever that means.

While you're at it, it's annoying that we have to go into
a Python shell to run our raffle. Can't we just have this
happen when we run the script, like so?

    $ python raffle.py
    Tell Blah ... that they've won

Advanced Problem!!!!!!!!!

Janet mentioned one more thing: it seems bad that
we have the code about customer stuff in the same file as
the code about the raffles. She says that was bad for
&quot;modularity&quot;. (Boy, she uses weird words!)

She created a new version of our app, in <cite>version2</cite>, where
she split things into two files. She had to run out before
she could finish, though, so she didn't get a chance to
finish. Can you finish her work here, so that things work
like they did before?

<p>Let's hope Mel doesn't have wifi, wherever he's golfing.</p>
<p>To Do:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Download all necessary files from the fellowship website</li>
<li>Set up a virtual environment. Reminder: in Windows, make sure you use
the command 'virtualenv env --always-copy'</li>
<li>Activate your virtual environment</li>
<li>Install &quot;ipython&quot; using <cite>pip</cite>.</li>
<li>Use the &quot;freeze&quot; functionality of pip to save your requirements.</li>
<li>Make sure the virtual environment doesn't ever get into git.</li>
<li>Fix the import error you get when you try to run the raffle.</li>
<li>Finish the work on version 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>P.S. There is preview material in this code, for some of the Classes and Object
Orientation that we'll start covering tomorrow. Don't get caught up in the syntax
for defining the Customer class or for setting up new customers. You don't need
to change anything about the files other than fixing imports and breaking them
into different parts.</p>
